Releases like the Shattered Backboard 1 and Bred Toe have shifted all eyes on Jordan�s �Black Toe� inspired colorways. The Royal Toe takes inspiration from the original Jordan 1 Royal colorway (which released in 1985) and adds design elements of the Black Toe 1 to create a familiar, but new dialogue.\n\nThis AJ 1 features a white and royal leather upper with black leather overlays and detailing. A white midsole, royal outsole, and branded leather tongue tag completes this design. These sneakers released in May of 2020 and retailed for $170 USD.","rate":4,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"royal-toe"}}},

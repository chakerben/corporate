This colorway was inspired by the orange and black jersey that Michael wore when he shattered a backboard in an Italian exhibition game in 1986.\nThis newest installment in the SBB series differs from the previous three in material. The design is comprised of a black and orange crinkled patent leather upper to represent the shattered glass. A yellowed vanilla mid and outsole complete the design. These sneakers released in October of 2019 and retailed for $160.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[{"id":2,"created_at":1636571770316,"deleted_at":null,"sneaker_ref_id":304,"size_id":20,"user_id":3,"selling_price":200}],"slug":"shattered-backboard-30"}}},

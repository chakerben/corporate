The OG sneaker returned in 2021 for the first time since its 1985 release, and Jordan Brand didn�t hold back on its details.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 �85 Neutral Grey features noticeable differences from other Jordan 1 High retros. The biggest difference is the Neutral Grey�s shape, as the slightly curved heel that has been standard since 2015�s Chicago 1s, is subbed with a straighter cut. From there, the �Wings� logo on the collar gets revamped with a more textured feel, while the Swoosh and collar underlays of Neutral Grey suede add to the sneaker�s original status.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 �85 Neutral Grey released in February of 2021 for $200.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"neutral-grey"}}},

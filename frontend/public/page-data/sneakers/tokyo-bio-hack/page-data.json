The LA sneaker boutique put their very unique spin on the basketball silhouette, adding bold colors and an unpadded throat of the shoe. Now, the same mismatched color pattern has returned, only this time it on the Air Jordan 1.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Bio Hack pushes the model to a whole new territory when it comes to color palettes. The upper is made of various suedes and leathers, matched with a hodgepodge of black, Baroque Brown, and Racer Pink. A metallic leather Swoosh is contrasted by a light green midsole to add even further appeal to the traditional model.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Bio Hack released in September of 2020 for $170.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"tokyo-bio-hack"}}},

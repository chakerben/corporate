Each Swoosh combines the white and grey into a camouflage pattern and winds around the back of the shoe, connecting to the other Swoosh on the opposite side. The laces themselves are also gray, and the toe is made of perforated leather. A black Jumpman adorns the tongue and a black Air Jordan Wings logo is on the heel.\n\nThe Jordan 1 Low White Camo was released in November of 2020 and retailed for $90.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"white-camo"}}},

The nearly 20-year-old colorway first made its appearance in 1991 during Michael Jordan�s �91-�92 season and brought in a new form of color blocking to the signature silhouette.\n\nThe Air Jordan 6 Carmine combines red, white, and black colors to represent the Chicago Bulls� signature colors. The upper features bold red and white colors that help the model pop while on foot. From there, the upper is met with a white and black midsole, with hits of an icy blue outsole appear as well. The final touch to this OG�s return is the signature �Nike Air� on the heel, replacing 2008 and 2012 retros� �Jumpman� logo.\n\nThe Air Jordan 6 Carmine released in February of 2021 for $200.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"carmine-2021"}}},

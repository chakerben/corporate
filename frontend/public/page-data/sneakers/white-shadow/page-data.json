A legendary shoe linked indelibly with a legendary basketball player, it was released in 1985, just at the end of Michael Jordan�s rookie year. Designer Peter Moore was told to produce something �different� and �exciting,� and he certainly delivered, creating a footwear dynasty in the process. Retro versions like the Jordan 1 Mid White Shadow have been beloved ever since.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Mid White Shadow is a mid-top shoe that comes in a special colorway that tastefully mixes black, white and gray together. As a real blast from the past, it makes use of the original Air Jordan 1�s Shadow design. It features a black leather mid-panel, a cool grey leather Swoosh that is made to be ever-so-slightly lighter than the Swoosh on the original Jordan 1, and a stylish white collar and heel that also contribute to maximum comfort. A white leather perforated toe, a black leather toe cap, lower eyelets, and a white Jumpman on its white leather tongue completes the design.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Mid White Shadow was released in October of 2020 and retailed for $115.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"white-shadow"}}},

Coming in gym red, black, and summit white, with red on the toe box, outsole, and wrapping around the ankle and heel, white side panels and midsole and black covering the rest of the sneaker, it�s a perfectly balanced mash-up of the Banned, Chicago, and Black Toe all in one. Originally releasing in February of 2018, the Bred toe has been one of the most popular sneakers on StockX since its drop. For fans of the AJ1, this colorway is a must Bid.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"bred-toe"}}},

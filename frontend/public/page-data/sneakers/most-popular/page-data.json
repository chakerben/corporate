First releasing in November of 2017, the Yeezy Boost 700�s represented what was a significant shift in Kanye�s design aesthetic, moving from the minimalistic silhouettes of early Yeezy seasons to this chunky runner model. It once again showed how Kanye stays ahead of the curve, as chunkier sneakers became more en vogue in 2018. The shoe features an upper with grey and black suede overlays, premium leather with blue mesh underlays, neon green laces, and its signature chunky midsole with encapsulated Boost technology. Translation: these may look bold but are still comfy as hell. The Yeezy Wave Runners will stay at the same retail cost of $300 for the upcoming restock, but have averaged a sale price well above retail on StockX since their initial drop. So if you�re looking to add these to your Yeezy collection, remember that fortune favors the bold bidders.","rate":4,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":{"path":"/vault/DGPMTOjr/FAcpEnvG/aQpHlA../Adidas-Yeezy-Wave-Runner-700-Solid-Grey-Product.png","name":"Adidas-Yeezy-Wave-Runner-700-Solid-Grey-Product.png","type":"image","size":26895,"mime":"image/png","meta":{"width":296,"height":338},"url":"https://xwcj-gm1t-djcw.m2.xano.io/vault/DGPMTOjr/FAcpEnvG/aQpHlA../Adidas-Yeezy-Wave-Runner-700-Solid-Grey-Product.png"},"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"solid-grey"},{"id":3,"created_at":1634584620000,"full_name":"Jordan 4 Retro Hot Punch (W)","sku":"AQ9128-600","nick_name":"Hot Punch (W)","path":"Home/Sneakers/Air Jordan/4/Jordan 4 Retro Hot Punch (W)","colorway":"HOT PUNCH/BLACK-VOLT","retail_price":190,"release_date":1516320000000,"desciption":"It's getting hot early in 2019, especially with the Jordan Brand celebrating the AJ4 30th anniversary by releasing the women's Jordan 4 Hot Punch (W).

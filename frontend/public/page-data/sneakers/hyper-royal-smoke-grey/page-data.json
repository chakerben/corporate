The Hyper Royal utilizes material selection and color blocking to provide a vintage feel, similar to the 2019 Air Jordan 1 High Turbo Green.\n\nThe upper of the Air Jordan 1 Hyper Royal is constructed with white leather and distressed Hyper Royal suede overlays while the Swoosh and panels around the ankle are made with a Light Smoke Grey Durabuck. Consistent with Jordan 1s of the past, a classic white �Wings� logo appears on the lateral ankle. A blue woven Nike Air label stitched on the tongue, a white midsole, and a Light Smoke Grey outsole add the finishing touches to this retro design.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 Hyper Royal released in April of 2021 and retailed for $170.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"hyper-royal-smoke-grey"}}},

Featuring a white, red and black-based deconstructed leather upper with a Swooshless medial side branded with \"Off-White for Nike Air Jordan 1, Beaverton, Oregon, USA � 1985.\" Other details include: floppy ankle collars with hidden �85� written on the inside, an oversized off-centered Swoosh on the lateral sides, \"Air\" written on the midsole and the word \"Shoelaces\" on the laces with no branding on the tongue. Their release date is set for 2017 where they retailed for $190 in men's sizes only. As if the hype wasn't enough, the limited availability made these Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG's highly sought after, way before their official release.

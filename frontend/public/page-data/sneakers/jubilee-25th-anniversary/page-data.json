To commemorate the famed silhouette, Michael Jordan and Nike released the Jordan 11 Jubilee. The sneaker�s distinct colorway was inspired by original sketches from the designer of the 1995 sneaker, Tinker Hatfield.\n\nThe Jordan 11 Jubilee showcases everything Hatfield envisioned for the sneaker 25 years ago; a performance product that can be worn easily both on and off the court. Features such as the two types of leather on the upper with hits of metallic lettering and Jumpman emblem add luxe elements to the athletic sneaker. A white midsole and foggy translucent outsole deliver contrast to the black sneaker. Carbon fiber plating on the sole provides stability and power to the wearer�s feet on the court.\n\nThe Jordan 11 Jubilee 25th Anniversary released in December of 2020 for $220.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"jubilee-25th-anniversary"}}},

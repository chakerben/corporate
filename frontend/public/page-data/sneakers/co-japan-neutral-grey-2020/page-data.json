The Air Jordan 1 CO.JP originally released as a Japanese exclusive in very limited quantities. Only 2,001 pairs were released in the Neutral Grey colorway while other colorways were produced as an edition of 3,000. After 20 years, the CO.JP was reborn and finally released globally.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 CO Japan Neutral Grey features a grey suede and silver leather upper with a bubble �Wings� stamp just like the 2001 version. The main difference between the 2020 iteration and its predecessor is in the tongue, where the updated pair features �Nike Air� embroidered on the tongue instead of the 2001s� Jumpman tag.\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 CO Japan Neutral Grey released in August of 2020 and retailed for $170.","rate":0,"brand_id":0,"category_id":0,"miniature":null,"_sneaker_item_of_sneaker_ref":[],"slug":"co-japan-neutral-grey-2020"}}},

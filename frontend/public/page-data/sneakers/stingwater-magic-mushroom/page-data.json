The collaboration draws inspiration from one of Stingwater's central motifs: psilocybin mushrooms, and their mythical properties.\n\nThe Nike SB Dunk Low Stingwater Magic Mushroom features a University Red leather upper with safari print overlays and cream corduroy lining, nodding to the gills of a mushroom. A mini jewel Swoosh is set on the quarter panel alongside Stingwater branding.
